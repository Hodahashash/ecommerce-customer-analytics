KEY FINDINGS:
1. AVERAGE RETENTION RATES:
   - Month 1: 100.0% (baseline)
   - Month 3: 22.4%
   - Month 6: 24.1%
   - Month 12: 29.7%

2. CHURN PATTERN:
   - Steepest drop typically occurs in first 3 months
   - Customers who survive month 3 have higher long-term retention

3. COHORT QUALITY:
   - Best performing cohort: 2009-12 (36.9% avg retention)
   - This suggests acquisition quality varies by month (seasonality/campaigns)

4. LTV CORRELATION:
   - Strong correlation between early retention and LTV
   - Focus on first 90 days is critical

RECOMMENDATIONS:
✓ Implement 30-60-90 day onboarding campaigns
✓ Identify what made top cohorts successful (replicate)
✓ Intervene at month 2-3 to prevent churn
✓ Segment marketing by cohort age (new vs mature customers)
