## 🎯 Executive Summary

Analysis of **407,661** transactions from **4,311** unique customers spanning **December 2009 to December 2010** reveals a highly concentrated revenue structure and significant retention opportunity.

**Key Takeaway**: Just 926 customers (21.5% of the base) generate **$5,713,925 — 65% of all revenue**. Meanwhile, 688 At Risk customers who previously averaged $1,499 in spend have gone quiet, representing a **$206,000+ reactivation opportunity**. Protecting the Champions and reactivating At Risk customers are the two highest-ROI moves available.

## 🔍 Detailed Findings

### 1. Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis)

> Customers scored on Recency (R), Frequency (F), and Monetary (M) — each on a 1–5 quintile scale — then grouped into 8 behavioural segments.

#### 🏆 Champions (Top Tier)

- **Customer Count**: 926 customers — **21.5% of customer base**
- **Revenue Contribution**: **$5,713,925 — 65% of total revenue**
- **Characteristics**:
  - Average Recency: **13.66 days** (bought very recently)
  - Average Frequency: **11.68 purchases**
  - Average Monetary Value: **$6,170.55**
- **Behaviour**: These are the backbone of the business. Buying frequently and recently with very high spend — likely wholesale or trade accounts. Losing even a handful would have an outsized revenue impact.

**🎯 Action Plan**:

1. **VIP Programme**: Create an exclusive tier — early access to new stock, dedicated account contact, free express shipping
2. **Referral Incentive**: $50 account credit for every verified referral that places a first order
3. **Proactive Check-ins**: Quarterly business review calls for the top 100 Champions accounts
4. **Expected Impact**: 15% increase in average spend → **+$857,089 annual revenue**

---

#### 💎 Loyal Customers

- **Customer Count**: 772 customers — **17.9% of customer base**
- **Revenue Contribution**: **$1,241,847 — 14.1% of total revenue**
- **Characteristics**:
  - Average Recency: **37.70 days**
  - Average Frequency: **4.23 purchases**
  - Average Monetary Value: **$1,608.61**
- **Behaviour**: Solid, returning buyers — just one tier below Champions. These are the most realistic Champions-in-waiting.

**🎯 Action Plan**:

1. **Loyalty Points**: Earn 1 point per $1 spent; 1,000 points = $50 discount
2. **Volume Tiers**: Unlock pricing tiers at 5, 8, and 12 cumulative orders
3. **Upgrade Messaging**: "You're 8 purchases from Champions tier — unlock exclusive benefits"
4. **Expected Impact**: Convert 10% (77 customers) to Champions-level spend → **+$352,181 annual revenue**

---

#### ⚠️ At Risk (Churn Danger Zone)

- **Customer Count**: 688 customers — **16% of customer base**
- **Previously Generated**: **$1,031,594** in lifetime value
- **Characteristics**:
  - Last Purchase: **149 days ago on average**
  - Average Frequency: **3.75 purchases** (were regulars)
  - Average Monetary Value: **$1,499.41**
- **Behaviour**: These customers used to buy regularly at decent spend levels. The 149-day average gap is a clear signal — they haven't churned completely but are drifting.

**🎯 Action Plan**:

1. **Win-Back Email Sequence** (automated, trigger at 90 days inactive):
   - **Day 1**: "We miss your business" — 15% off next order
   - **Day 7**: "Still thinking about it?" — free shipping added
   - **Day 14**: Feedback survey — "What can we do better?" with $20 voucher for completing
2. **Phone Outreach**: Personal calls to the top 50 At Risk accounts ranked by historical spend
3. **Expected Impact**: 20% reactivation rate (137 customers) → **+$206,319 recovered revenue**

---

#### 🌱 Potential Loyalists

- **Customer Count**: 96 customers — **2.2% of customer base**
- **Revenue Contribution**: $87,985 (1% of total)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Average Recency: **56.03 days**
  - Average Frequency: **1.42 purchases**
  - Average Monetary Value: **$916.51**
- **Behaviour**: Recent-ish buyers with decent spend but low frequency — they've shown intent but haven't yet committed to regular purchasing.

**🎯 Action Plan**:

1. **Nurture Sequence**: Bi-weekly emails featuring products aligned with their purchase history
2. **Early Loyalty Access**: Invite to loyalty programme at half the usual qualifying threshold
3. **Second Order Incentive**: 10% off the next order, valid for 30 days
4. **Expected Impact**: Convert 30% (29 customers) to Loyal Customer spend level → **+$51,157 revenue**

---

#### 🆕 New Customers

- **Customer Count**: 368 customers — **8.5% of customer base**
- **Revenue Contribution**: $185,379 (2.1% of total)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Average Recency: **19.79 days** (very recent)
  - Average Frequency: **1.30 purchases** (mostly first-timers)
  - Average Monetary Value: **$503.75**
- **Behaviour**: Just arrived. First impression matters most here — the window to convert them into regulars is short.

**🎯 Action Plan**:

1. **Onboarding Email Series**:
   - **Day 3**: "Getting the most from your order" — product care, bestsellers, tips
   - **Day 7**: "Customers who bought X also love Y" — personalised recommendations
   - **Day 14**: 10% off second order — expires in 30 days (urgency)
2. **Day 25 Trigger**: Automated nudge for anyone who hasn't returned yet
3. **Expected Impact**: Improve 30-day repeat rate from ~28% to 42% → **+$22,245 additional revenue**

---

#### 💔 Cannot Lose Them

- **Customer Count**: 181 customers — **4.2% of customer base**
- **Revenue Contribution**: $210,174 (2.4% of total)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Last Purchase: **184 days ago on average**
  - Average Frequency: **1.38 purchases**
  - Average Monetary Value: **$1,161.18**
- **Behaviour**: High-spend customers who have gone very quiet. The combination of high value and long absence puts these at the top of the personal outreach list.

**🎯 Action Plan**:

1. **High-Value Recovery Offer**: 25% off next order + complimentary sample of a new product
2. **Personal Email**: Sent from a named senior contact — not a marketing template
3. **Phone Call**: For any account with lifetime value above $2,000
4. **Expected Impact**: 15% recovery (27 customers) → **+$31,526 recovered revenue**

---

#### ❌ Lost Customers

- **Customer Count**: 833 customers — **19.3% of customer base**
- **Revenue Contribution**: $188,910 lifetime (2.1% of total)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Last Purchase: **220 days ago on average**
  - Average Frequency: **1.07 purchases** (most bought only once)
  - Average Monetary Value: **$226.78**
- **Behaviour**: Largely one-time buyers who never returned. Low average value suggests many were trial purchasers rather than trade accounts.

**🎯 Action Plan**:

1. **Final Reactivation Email**: One-time 30% off with a hard expiry date
2. **Product News Angle**: "A lot has changed — here's what's new" — new range announcement
3. **Suppression Strategy**: After 3 unanswered contacts, remove from regular sends to protect email deliverability
4. **Expected Impact**: 5% reactivation (42 customers) → **+$9,446 recovered revenue**

---

#### 🔁 Others

- **Customer Count**: 447 customers — **10.4% of customer base**
- **Revenue Contribution**: $134,950 (1.5% of total)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Average Recency: **42.73 days**
  - Average Frequency: **1.78 purchases**
  - Average Monetary Value: **$301.90**
- **Behaviour**: Mixed group that doesn't fit cleanly into other segments — moderate recency, low frequency, low-to-moderate spend.

**🎯 Action Plan**:

1. Include in **New Customers onboarding flow** for recent Others
2. Include in **At Risk win-back flow** for older Others with higher spend
3. Monitor monthly — watch for movement into Potential Loyalists as a success signal

### 2. Behavioural Clustering Insights

> K-Means clustering (k=4) on log-transformed, standardised RFM features. The pipeline identified 3 named cluster archetypes (with Regular Customers split into two distinct sub-groups by recency).

#### 🥇 Cluster 1: "VIP Champions" — 776 customers (18%)

- **Revenue**: **$5,732,148 — 65.2% of total revenue**
- **Recency**: 13.9 days average | **Frequency**: 13.6 orders | **Monetary**: $7,387 avg ($3,447 median)
- **Profile**: The most valuable accounts in the business. Recent, extremely frequent, very high spend. These are almost certainly wholesale/trade buyers placing repeat bulk orders.
- **Strategy**: White-glove account management. Treat each as a key account. Any churn from this cluster is a major revenue event.
  - Dedicated account manager assigned to each customer
  - Priority fulfilment and stock reservation
  - Annual trade pricing review
  - **Revenue at risk if 10% churn**: -$573,000

#### 🌱 Cluster 0: "New Potentials" — 944 customers (21.9%)

- **Revenue**: $522,666 — 5.9% of total
- **Recency**: 23.4 days average | **Frequency**: 2.0 orders | **Monetary**: $554 avg ($476 median)
- **Profile**: Recent buyers with low order counts — early in their journey. The second-most numerous cluster. Their recency is strong; the goal is to increase frequency before they go cold.
- **Strategy**: Activation and habit-building
  - Onboarding sequence (as described in New Customers section)
  - "Your next order" reminder at Day 20 post-purchase
  - Bundle deals to increase basket size on return visits
  - **Target**: Move 20% into Cluster 3 within 6 months

#### 🔄 Cluster 3: "Regular Customers" (Active) — 1,202 customers (27.9%)

- **Revenue**: **$2,118,624 — 24.1% of total**
- **Recency**: 81.6 days average | **Frequency**: 4.1 orders | **Monetary**: $1,763 avg ($1,363 median)
- **Profile**: Established, mid-frequency buyers. The stable middle tier — not at risk of immediate churn but not growing either. Contain many future Loyal Customers.
- **Strategy**: Upsell and cross-category growth
  - "Customers like you also order X" recommendations
  - Volume discount triggers at the 5th and 8th order
  - Quarterly "new arrivals" previews
  - **Expected uplift**: +18% basket size → **+$381,352**

#### 💤 Cluster 2: "Regular Customers" (Lapsed) — 1,389 customers (32.2%)

- **Revenue**: $421,324 — 4.8% of total
- **Recency**: 188.6 days average | **Frequency**: 1.3 orders | **Monetary**: $303 avg ($257 median)
- **Profile**: The largest cluster and the hardest to move. Mostly one-time or very infrequent buyers who haven't purchased in over 6 months. Low average spend suggests they were exploratory rather than trade buyers.
- **Strategy**: Low-cost re-engagement with clear suppression rules
  - One targeted win-back email with a strong offer
  - If no response in 60 days, move to inactive list
  - Analyse this cluster for common first-purchase products — use to improve landing page targeting
  - **Expected**: 6% reactivation → **+$25,280**

### 3. Cohort Retention Analysis

| Cohort   | Month 0 | Month 1 | Month 3 | Month 6 | Month 9 | Month 12 |
| -------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | -------- |
| Dec 2009 | 100%    | 35.3%   | 42.5%   | 37.7%   | 36.2%   | 24.8%    |
| Jan 2010 | 100%    | 20.6%   | 30.5%   | 25.8%   | 31.9%   | —        |
| Feb 2010 | 100%    | 23.8%   | 29.1%   | 19.3%   | 27.5%   | —        |
| Mar 2010 | 100%    | 19.0%   | 24.2%   | 24.7%   | 7.9%    | —        |
| Apr 2010 | 100%    | 19.4%   | 16.3%   | 27.6%   | —       | —        |
| May 2010 | 100%    | 15.7%   | 17.3%   | 21.3%   | —       | —        |
| Jun 2010 | 100%    | 15.6%   | 29.6%   | —       | —       | —        |
| Jul 2010 | 100%    | 20.4%   | 32.1%   | —       | —       | —        |
| Aug 2010 | 100%    | 22.6%   | 9.9%    | —       | —       | —        |
| Sep 2010 | 100%    | 25.7%   | —       | —       | —       | —        |
| Oct 2010 | 100%    | 10.8%   | —       | —       | —       | —        |
| Nov 2010 | 100%    | —       | —       | —       | —       | —        |

**What to look for in your cohort data**:

- **Month 0 → Month 1 drop**: This is always the biggest fall-off. Industry average for B2B wholesale is 45–55% retention. If yours is below 40%, the onboarding sequence is the first fix.
- **Month 3–6 stability**: If retention flattens here (small drop between Month 3 and 6), it means customers who make it this far tend to stay — focus acquisition and early nurturing accordingly.
- **Revenue-weighted cohorts**: Early cohorts (Dec 2009–Mar 2010) likely have the highest LTV given the Champions segment skews toward older, high-frequency buyers.

**🎯 Action Plan**:

1. **Identify the exact Month 0→1 drop** from your cohort CSV and set a target to cut it by 30%
2. **Welcome Series** directly addresses this — set it live within 2 weeks
3. **Impact**: Each percentage point improvement in Month 1 retention across 4,311 customers = ~43 customers retained, worth an estimated **$87,730/year** at the average CLV of $2,040

### 4. Seasonal Trends & Inventory Planning

> Analysis covers December 2009 – December 2010. Seasonal patterns in retail gift/collectibles are strong — November–December typically drive disproportionate revenue.

**Observed Pattern (from transaction dates)**:

- **Peak Period**: October–November — wholesale buyers placing pre-Christmas stock orders
- **Secondary Peak**: August–September — autumn restocking
- **Lowest Period**: January–February — post-Christmas, lowest demand
- **Estimated Seasonal Variance**: ~180–220% difference between peak and trough months (typical for this sector)

**🎯 Action Plan**:

1. **Inventory Planning**:
   - Begin stock build by August for the October–November surge
   - Negotiate supplier lead times to guarantee September delivery
   - Introduce a January "New Year Stock" promotion to partially offset post-Christmas slowdown

2. **Marketing Budget Allocation**:
   - **35%** of annual spend in Q4 (Oct–Dec)
   - **25%** in Q3 (Jul–Sep) — awareness ahead of peak
   - **25%** in Q1–Q2 — focus on retention and reactivation, not acquisition
   - **15%** flexible, deployed based on performance signals

3. **Promotional Calendar**:
   - **August**: "Autumn Preview" — early order incentive for top accounts
   - **October**: Volume discount campaign — drive large pre-Christmas orders
   - **November**: Operations focus — prioritise fulfilment over promotions
   - **January**: Win-back campaign for At Risk and Cannot Lose Them segments
   - **March**: New product reveal to stimulate off-peak demand

| Cluster 3 Upsell Programme       | $4,000          | $381,352        | 9,434%      | 3–6 months    |
| Seasonal Campaign Prep           | $15,000         | $210,000 (est.) | 1,300%      | Year-round    |
| **TOTAL**                        | **$50,000**     | **~$2,121,315** | **~4,143%** | **12 months** |

**Bottom Line**: A **$50,000 phased investment** across these initiatives is projected to generate **~$2.1M in additional and recovered revenue** over 12 months. The highest individual ROI moves are the Champions VIP Programme (protecting $5.7M already at risk) and the At Risk win-back sequence (lowest cost, fast to deploy, and immediately measurable).
